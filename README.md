# flutter_calculator_app

A Flutter-based calculator app to perform basic arithmetic operations with a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

#### Day 1: Orientation and Setup
Participated in an online orientation session.
Virtual meeting with project mentor to discuss objectives and requirements.
Set up development environment: installed Flutter SDK and Android Studio.
Reviewed Flutter documentation and explored sample projects.
#### Day 2: Project Scope and Design
Defined the scope of the calculator app (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Sketched a simple, user-friendly design for the calculator interface.
Created a new Flutter project and set up the basic project structure.
#### Day 3: User Interface Implementation
Implemented the user interface using Flutter widgets (Container, Row, Column, Buttons).
Designed and implemented buttons for digits (0-9) and arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
Tested the app on an emulator for proper alignment and spacing.
Made adjustments to refine the UI.
#### Day 4: State Management and Input Handling
Learned about state management in Flutter and decided to use setState.
Added onPressed events to buttons to capture and display user input.
Implemented logic to handle and display current input and results using a Text widget.
#### Day 5: Core Functionality and Final Review
Implemented core arithmetic operations.
Captured and stored input values and operations in variables.
Tested arithmetic operations to ensure correctness.
Reviewed and refactored the code for readability and efficiency.
Documented the code and pushed it to GitHub.

### Summary of Work Done
